## git Hidden folder

There is a hidden folder called `.git` which tells you that our project is a git repo

Revise commande `git init`

## Reset 
Reset allows you to move staged changes to be unstaged. 
this is useful when you want to revert all files not being committed. 

## cloning

we can clone three ways: Https, SSh, Github cli
Since we are using Github codespaces we'll create a temporary directory in our workspace

### https

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Qassim-Coding/First-Project.github.io/tree/421161c324df27319ca96dd61a63ce2b35993304
